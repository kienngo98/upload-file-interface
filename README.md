# upload-file-interface
Simple interface built with Tailwind CSS &amp; NextJS for uploading files

Inspired by this article: <https://www.section.io/engineering-education/nextjs-dnd-file-upload/>

The UI contains 2 main components: 

1. A DropZone for uploading files (either by browsing the file explorer or by drag-and-dropping)
2. A FileReview for showing all the files that you uploaded to the DropZone
